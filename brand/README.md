# Brand stuff

This is just a little collection of the bits of work I did around a potential brand. Based on the existing stuff:

I imagined using a similar diagonal grid structure but playing with the colours a little more and started investigating how the LSX character could be placed on it.

This would then be combined with something like the [animation work](http://morganesque.com/lsx/animation/) to form the basis of the main "hero" panel for the home page ([demo](http://morganesque.com/lsx/webdesign/build/)) but also a recurring motive on different parts of the site.
