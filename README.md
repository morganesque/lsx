# LSx

This repo contains all the work done for the proposed LSx website.

### Wordpress theme (& data structure)
A Wordpress theme is included [lsx5](https://github.com/morganesque/lsx/tree/master/lsx5). This includes a SQL dump, and plugins required to recreate the site on a server with PHP and MySQL available. This reflects all work done to prepare a suitable data structure for the proposed content.

Further instructions for deployment of this can be found in this [README file](https://github.com/morganesque/lsx/tree/master/lsx5).

### Design
There is some initial visual design ideas that can be found in the [branding](https://github.com/morganesque/lsx/tree/master/branding) folder.

There is an [example web layout](http://morganesque.com/lsx/webdesign/build/) that would have formed the basis for the visual design of the final Wordpress theme.

There is [some animation work](http://morganesque.com/lsx/animation/) based around the visual design ideas which would have formed the basis for a home page hero panel and a recurring motif for the rest of the site.
