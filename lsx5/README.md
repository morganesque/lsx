# Latest LSx Wordpres Theme

This is the latest wordpress theme which supports the Places,
Events, People, Talks (& Videos) data structure.

##Â Theme
The theme folder contains the basic display pages for each type of data with a simple linkage mechanism already in place to show the way the different data types link up.

i.e. The people pages show a list of talks, the Talk pages show people and events, the Event pages show places and list talks  etc etc.

The theme is based on Bones which was a nice Wordpress theme starting point thing at the time. It's probably changed thought since.

# Plugins
The plugins directory from my working copy is also included here as parts of the data structure are reliant on things that specific plugins do. The first step in re-creating the site would be to include this folder and get the site running before attempting to update any of these plugins to more recent versions.

# Wordpress version
The version of wordpress that this was all build on was **3.9.1**. Again would be best to recreate the site on that version in order to make sure it works before attempting to update Wordpress.

# SQL
A data dump of a working version of the database for this site is also included. Again installing this version of the data base along with the other files would be a good first step in getting the site up and running somewhere.

# Logins
If the above database is used there is one admin user included on the system username: `tommo` password: `9^#xT9m40.Ah8TU`
