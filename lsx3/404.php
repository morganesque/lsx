        <h2>Page not found?</h2>
        <p>Oh fiddle sticks! It seems that we've lost the page you're looking for. How careless. And look! We've lost the owl as well. My god, this whole place is going to rack and ruin.</p>
        <p>It wasn't always like this you know. Oh no! It used to be a very spick and span place but, you know, over time things have kind of got on top of us. Weeds have started poking up through the cracks and (yes, we admit it) there's pieces of content like the one you're after which seem to have cumbled away.</p>
        <p>And now the owl too! That really is unfortunate. If you happen to see him around do grab him for us won't you. Just stick him in a bag or something and drop him on the steps of Old Broadcasting House.</p>

        <p>If you're still here after all that you really must be desperate for reading material. He's some Shakespeare:</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>To be, or not to be, that is the Question:<br />
            Whether 'tis Nobler in the minde to suffer<br />
            The Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune,<br />
            Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles,<br />
            And by opposing end them: to dye, to sleepe<br />
            No more; and by a sleepe, to say we end<br />
            The Heart-ake, and the thousand Naturall shockes<br />
            That Flesh is heyre too? 'Tis a consummation<br />
            Deuoutly to be wish'd. To dye to sleepe,<br />
            To sleepe, perchance to Dreame; I, there's the rub,<br />
            For in that sleepe of death, what dreames may come,<br />
            When we haue shuffel'd off this mortall coile,<br />
            Must give us pawse. There's the respect<br />
            That makes Calamity of so long life:<br />
            For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time,<br />
            The Oppressors wrong, the poore mans Contumely,<br />
            The pangs of dispriz'd Loue, the Lawes delay,<br />
            The insolence of Office, and the Spurnes<br />
            That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br />
            When he himselfe might his Quietus make<br />
            With a bare Bodkin? Who would these Fardles beare<br />
            To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br />
            But that the dread of something after death,<br />
            The undiscouered Countrey, from whose Borne<br />
            No Traueller returnes, Puzels the will,<br />
            And makes us rather beare those illes we haue,<br />
            Then flye to others that we know not of.<br />
            Thus Conscience does make Cowards of us all,<br />
            And thus the Native hew of Resolution<br />
            Is sicklied o're, with the pale cast of Thought,<br />
            And enterprizes of great pith and moment,<br />
            With this regard their Currants turne away,<br />
            And loose the name of Action. Soft you now,<br />
            The faire Ophelia? Nimph, in thy Orizons<br />
            Be all my sinnes remembred</p>
